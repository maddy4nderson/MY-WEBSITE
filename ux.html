       <p class="reflection">When making my website I wanted to create a personal aspect by including background images that I had taken myself. I think this reflects my own creativity in a good way. It also shows specific moments in my life that I thought were fun to document, things that intrigued me. Making it my own and having the freedom to play around with the structure definitely made learning about HTML and CSS quite fun. 

        After taking two years out from education, I knew that Iâ€™d struggle with motivation when working. However starting to work with graphic and web design has definitely made me acknowledge how much I enjoy design and exploring with my own creativity in different medias. Writing code is a completely new skill for me so it did take a moment for me to properly get into it. However, I after practicing quite a bit I understand now how it works making it fun to trail what my website looked like. 
        
        I knew from the start I wanted a simple home page mainly showcasing the navigation bar and a little introduction to me. I used the coding worksheet, when we made the buttons, to set up my own menu. I liked how I could change the colour of the option when hovering over it, making it clear where I was and which section I was choosing. I think this is such an important feature in navigating around a website in order to keep organised. Saying this I also wanted to maintain a consistent structure using a flexbox. So within my other pages I managed to structure following an even split going across the website then following down, keeping things close together when needed to make each aspect clear to where it linked the next. 
        
        Each page was manipulated in a way to match each focus. For example, for my typography page I split each image evenly across two sections, making it visually satisfying whilst including all the information needed. At first try I started with the description underneath each image. However due to my chosen background, it was hard in some places the read the text. So after a bit of searching I learnt how to make it so when you hovered over the image the specific description would show up. This made it so much easier to read and identify the text was image it was meant for. 
        
        Overall, I think the use of trial and error was really helpful in determining my own style within my website. I definitely struggled to make each feature easily manipulated due to the size of the screen, but I think I definitely tried my hardest in each section of the website. Graphic and Web Design is definitely a strong interest of mine. </p>
