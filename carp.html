        <h2 class="hposter">REPETITION</h2>
        <p class="caption">For my repetition poster, I thought it would look cool if I used what I learnt in Adobe Illustator
          when doing the typography systems work, to make the words form around a guitar.
          This highlights the focus of the poster as it is to promote a film/ music festival.This also
          meets the aim of repetition as I used the lines formed around the guitar, repeating the title of 
          'True/False Film Fesitval' continously filling the page. This flows stabilty through the 
          poster, allowing for the information within to be presented as confident and significant.

        <div class="posters">
        <img src="CARP Posters2.jpg" alt= "contrast" style= "width: 100%">
        <h2 class="hposter">CONTRAST</h2>
        <p class="caption">To meet the aim of contrast I decided to use scale. I started 
          with drawing the focus to the letters of T and F. Scaling the letters to the whole page
          you'd think would be the aspect making the poster seem important, however I think real draw in    
          would be the minimal text within the poster. Just how the front face seems to scream 
          urgency but when drawn in you aren't greeted with details and details, instead,
          the information you need. Things you always look for: what is it? where? when?
          I also created contrast in the colours of the T and F whilst also matching the theme
          within the festivals logo.
